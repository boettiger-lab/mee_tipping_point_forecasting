To train and evaluate a model individually use `train.py`. Run `python train.py -h` to see what the command line arguments are. With train, you currently have three available models: LSTM's TCN's and transformers. The hyperparameters used for each model are found in the `train_hyperparams/` directory. There the hyperparameters are formatted in a dictionary. So if you want to edit a training setup TCN e.g., you'd have to go into `train_hyperparms/tcn.py`, change the hyperparameters of interest then call `python train.py -m tcn ...`.

To tune a model, use `tune.py`. Again, run `python train.py -h` to get a sense of what the command line arguments are. Tuning is performed according to a random grid search over the hyperparameters. The structure here is similar to `train.py` where the available hyperparameters for tuning are stored in `tune_hyperparams`. Instead of just having one float/str for each hyperparameter key in `tune_hyperparams/[model].py`, instead there is a list where you can specify the hyperparameters you'd like to search over.
